"""Which uv extras each Ray actor needs. The single source of truth.

Two readers:

* ``nemo_rl.distributed.ray_actor_environment_registry`` imports
  ``ACTOR_ENVIRONMENTS`` and turns it into ``py_executable`` strings at runtime.
* ``docker/Dockerfile`` runs this file **as a script** to list the venvs it must
  pre-build, so the image ships one venv per actor.

DO NOT IMPORT ANYTHING FROM ``nemo_rl`` HERE, AND KEEP IT STDLIB-ONLY.
The Dockerfile runs this from the dependency layer, where only this file and
``pyproject.toml``/``uv.lock`` exist -- the rest of the source tree has not been
copied in yet. Running it as a script (rather than importing it) is also what
keeps ``nemo_rl/__init__.py`` from executing there. An import added here breaks
the image build in its most expensive layer.
``tests/unit/distributed/test_actor_environments.py`` enforces this.
